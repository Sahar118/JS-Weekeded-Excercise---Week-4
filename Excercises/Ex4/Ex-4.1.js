// “Write a function to return an n element in Fibonacci sequence” is one of the most common 
// questions you can hear during the coding challenge interview part. In this blogpost I’m going to 
// walk through the two of the most typical solutions for this problem and also cover a dreadful (for 
// most of novice developers) topic of time complexity. 
// So what is a Fibonacci sequence? According to ​Wikipedia​: 
// “In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, 
// called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first 
// two is the sum of the two preceding ones.” 
// Depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence (0 or 1) the sequence would look like 
// this: 
// 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... 
// or this: 
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

const FibonacciNum = function (n) {
    if (n === 1) {
      return [0, 1];
    } else {
      let i = FibonacciNum(n - 1);
      i.push(i[i.length - 1] + i[i.length - 2]);
      return i;
    }
  };
  
  console.log(FibonacciNum(12));
